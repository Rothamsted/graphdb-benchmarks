## Import from GraphML
Usual syntax: 

```groovy
g.io ( "/tmp/test.xml" ).read ().iterate ()
# Didn't try, but it should work
g.graph.io(graphml()).readGraph('/tmp/test.graphml')
```

This should allow for timing:
```
fpath = '/local/docker/tmp/rdf2pg-benchmark/data/biopax_20210322-graphml.xml'
clockWithResult (1) {
  g.io ( fpath ).read ().iterate ()
}
```


## Labels

Gremlin doesn't have multiple labels, so use the syntax `L1:L2:L3`. Then you can at least filter 
by label

```groovy
g.V().hasLabel ( containing ( 'Person' ) )
```

## Indexes

In SQL:

```sql
create property `Person:Resource`.`label` string
create index on `Person:Resource` ( `label` ) notunique
```

there is also the full_text type, but [I can't make it working](https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb/issues/1062).


## All node labels and all node edges

```groovy
g.V().label().dedup ()
g.E().label().dedup ()
```

## Inspecting the schema

As reported by the manual:

* select from schema:types to retrieve the defined types
* select from schema:indexes to retrieve the defined indexes
* select from schema:database to retrieve information about database settings
